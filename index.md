title: "What am I up to?"
--- 


I am a PhD Student and my research is centered around solidification of metals and alloys. I write large C++ programs that approximately solves the partial-differential-equations that govern solidification and other relevant phenomenon like fluid flow, heat transfer etc. 


As of yet, I have majorly worked on the Phase-Field simulations ([what id phase field?](notes_pfm.html)). More specifically, I have developed a GPU solver for the Kim-Kim-Suzuki equations, as my M.tech thesis, which you can find [here](UG_KKS.html).


My major interests are Complex-Systems and Multi-Physics simulations.
