the Kim-Kim-Suzuki model with thermodynamic database coupling.\
- Studied the solidification of AlZn, NiAl, NiNb and
NiAlMo systems; eutectic of Al-Zn and the L12 precipitate of NiAlMo.\
- Code developed in C++ using
[SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/), MPI and
[OneAPI](https://www.oneapi.io/). Simulations were bookmarked against
existing [MicroSim](https://microsim.co.in/) solvers.\
Learned : Intermediate Phase-Field (WB, KKS models etc.), Computational
Thermodynamics.

#### Phase-Field modelling of basic microstructure evolution phenomenon.

*UG Research Course I & II (15 credits)* ---- July 2021 - May 2022\
- Simulated Diffusion, Spinodal Decomposition and
Dendritic Solidification numerically with the Finite Difference method.\
- Investigated the effect of undercooling, boundary
conditions, anisotropy and other parameters on the microstructure.\
- Developed three parallel programs in C/C++ with
each of OpenCL, MPI and SYCL frameworks in their respective style.\
- Tested the programs across devices (CPUs, GPUs) and
platforms (Intel, Nvidia) for efficiency, scaling, memory usage etc.\
Learned : Basic Phase-Field, Solidification, OpenCL, SYCL, MPI.

### Combinatiorial Alloy Design & Correlative Microscopy Group Guide: Prof. K. G. Pradeep

calculate grain size and morphology and identify precipitates formed.\
Learned : XRD calculations, Optical Microscopy, Sample Polishing.

#### Atom Probe Tomography (APT) Data Analysis for feature detection in a MAX Phase

*Young Research Fellowship Project* --- Oct 2021 - June 2022.\
- Identified the elements and their distribution from
the mass spectrum and raw APT data of a $Cr_2Al(Si)C$ MAX Phase.\
- Learned and implemented Cluster Analysis, Proximity
histograms and Distribution Maps to extract interfaces and clusters.\

#### A critical review of the steady state creep behavior of an alloy. 

- Calculated creep activation energy and stress
exponent by fitting the creep equation to the creep curve \[[Pandey et
al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-6454(96)00225-X)\].\
- Identified the LSR mechanism to be gb diffusion
controlled gb sliding and the HSR mechanism to be dislocation creep.
