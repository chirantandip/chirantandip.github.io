abstract = {A phase-field model is developed for simulating quantitatively microstructural pattern formation in solidification of dilute binary alloys with coupled heat and solute diffusion. The model reduces to the sharp-interface equations in a computationally tractable thin-interface limit where (i) the width of the diffuse interface is about one order of magnitude smaller than the radius of curvature of the interface but much larger than the real microscopic width of a solid-liquid interface, and (ii) kinetic effects are negligible. A recently derived antitrapping current [A. Karma, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 115701 (2001)] is used in the solute conservation equation to recover precisely local equilibrium at the interface and to eliminate interface stretching and surface diffusion effects that arise when tKim1999he solutal diffusivities are unequal in the solid and liquid. Model results are first compared to analytical solutions for one-dimensional steady-state solidification. Two-dimensional thermosolutal dendritic growth simulations with vanishing solutal diffusivity in the solid show that both the microstructural evolution and the solute profile in the solid are accurately modeled by the present approach. Results are then presented that illustrate the utility of the model for simulating dendritic solidification for the large ratios of the liquid thermal to solutal diffusivities (Lewis numbers) typical of alloys. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We use a computationally efficient phase-field formulation to investigate the origin and dynamics of sidebranching in directional solidification for realistic parameters of a dilute alloy previously studied experimentally. Sidebranching is found to result either from noise amplification or from deterministic oscillations that exist both in two dimensions and in a three-dimensional thin-sample geometry. The oscillatory branch of growth solutions bifurcates subcritically from the main steady-state branch of solutions and exists over a finite range of large array spacings. In contrast, noise-induced sidebranching is associated with a smooth transition where the sidebranching amplitude increases exponentially with spacing up to nonlinear saturation due to the overlap of diffusion fields from neighboring cells, as observed experimentally. In the latter case where sidebranching is noise-induced, we find that increasing the externally imposed thermal gradient reduces the onset velocity and wavelength of sidebranching, as also observed experimentally. We show that this counterintuitive effect is due to tip blunting with increasing thermal gradient that promotes noise amplification in the tip region. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We develop and analyze a two-mode phase-field-crystal model to describe fcc ordering. The model is formulated by coupling two different sets of crystal density waves corresponding to 111 and 200 reciprocal lattice vectors, which are chosen to form triads so as to produce a simple free-energy landscape with coexistence of crystal and liquid phases. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with numerical examples of polycrystalline and (111) twin growth. We use a two-mode amplitude expansion to characterize analytically the free-energy landscape of the model, identifying parameter ranges where fcc is stable or metastable with respect to bcc. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for the elastic constants for both fcc and bcc. Those expressions show that a nonvanishing amplitude of [200] density waves is essential to obtain mechanically stable fcc crystals with a nonvanishing tetragonal shear modulus (C11 - C12) /2. We determine the model parameters for specific materials by fitting the peak liquid structure factor properties and solid-density wave amplitudes following the approach developed for bcc. This procedure yields reasonable predictions of elastic constants for both bcc Fe and fcc Ni using input parameters from molecular dynamics simulations. The application of the model to two-dimensional square lattices is also briefly examined. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Propagating cracks can exhibit a rich dynamical behavior controlled by a subtle interplay between microscopic failure processes in the crack tip region and macroscopic elasticity. We review recent approaches to understand crack dynamics using the phase field method. This method, developed originally for phase transformations, has the well-known advantage of avoiding explicit front tracking by making material interfaces spatially diffuse. In a fracture context, this method is able to capture both the short-scale physics of failure and macroscopic linear elasticity within a self-consistent set of equations that can be simulated on experimentally relevant length and time scales. We discuss the relevance of different models, which stem from continuum field descriptions of brittle materials and crystals, to address questions concerning crack path selection and branching instabilities, as well as models that are based on mesoscale concepts for crack tip scale selection. Open questions which may be addressed using phase field models of fracture are summarized. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Understanding the microstructural evolution within the production chain and its consequences for the mechanical characteristics allows to improve the material properties by changing specific process parameters. In addition to experiments, numerical methods are a helpful tool to explore these correlations. For this purpose, we present an elastic multiphase-field model to study the martensitic phase transformation in a DP microstructure. An EBSD scan of an as-received commercial DP600 finished strip is used to generate a virtual, initial ferritic-austenitic microstructure. Based on the initial polycrystalline microstructure, the applied multiphase-field model is able to predict the evolution of the martensitic variants in austenitic grains, including grain boundary and autocatalytic nucleation. The approach identifies grain boundaries lying parallel or perpendicular to the habit plane of martensitic variants as preferred nucleation sites. We discuss the resulting stress distribution and show its correlations to retained austenite.},

abstract = {We developed an efficient computation scheme for the phase-field simulation of grain growth, which allows unlimited number of the orientation variables and high computational efficiency independent of them. Large-scale phase-field simulations of the ideal grain growth in two-dimensions (2D) and three-dimensions (3D) were carried out with holding the coalescence-free condition, where a few tens of thousands grains evolved into a few thousand grains. By checking the validity of the von Neumann-Mullins law for individual grains, it could be shown that the present simulations were correctly carried out under the conditions of the ideal grain growth. The steady-state grain size distribution in 2D appeared as a symmetrical shape with a plateau slightly inclined to the small grain side, which was quite different from the Hillert 2D distribution. The existence of the plateau stems from the wide separation of the peaks in the size distributions of the grains with five, six, and seven sides. The steady-state grain size distribution in 3D simulation of the ideal grain growth appeared to be very close to the Hillert 3D distribution, independent of the initial average grain size and size distribution. The mean-field assumption, the Lifshitz-Slyozov stability condition, and all resulting predictions in the Hillert 3D theory were in excellent agreement with the present 3D simulation. Thus the Hillert theory can be regarded as an accurate description for the 3D ideal grain growth. The dependence of the growth rate in 3D simulations on the grain topology were discussed. The large-scale phase-field simulation confirms the 3D growth law obtained from the Surface Evolver simulations in smaller scales. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

There are, however, assumptions which are inconsistent with practical experience and it is important to realise the limitations of the method.

abstract = {Fe-Cu low-carbon steels play significant roles in a rich variety of applications. The high strength of Fe-Cu steels originates from the strengthening effect of Cu precipitates. Further optimization of mechanical properties of Fe-Cu and Fe-Cu based steels requires an understanding of precipitation process of Cu particles. In this study, a comprehensive phase field model is developed which captures the microstructure evolution process during the nucleation and growth of BCC Cu precipitates followed by the BCC → 9R phase transformation. Results generated by phase field simulations agree well with previous experimental reports. In addition, the pseudo-spinodal decomposition theory is adopted to analyze the kinetic process of precipitation. Our simulation results and theoretical analyses jointly demonstrate that the kinetic process of precipitation and the initial Cu concentration of precipitates are ageing temperature and composition dependent, which is helpful in solving the mystery of the Cu concentration in precipitates of early stage. Moreover, interfacial energy and internal stress are found to be responsible for the temperature and composition dependence of critical nucleation size of the 9R phase, respectively. The nature of wetting layer and the mechanism that regulates the thickness of wetting layers are revealed as well. The comprehensive phase field model developed in this study offers a powerful tool for investigating precipitations in Fe-Cu alloys. The findings of this study provide new insights on the evolution process of Cu precipitates in Fe-Cu alloys.},

In addition to normal interface motion driven by a given interface speed or by interface curvature, interface advection by an arbitrary external velocity field is also considered. In the absence of curvature-driven interface motion, a previously developed counter term is used in the phase-field equation to cancel out such motion. Various modifications of the phase-field equation, including nonlinear preconditioning, are also investigated. The accuracy of the present method is demonstrated in several numerical examples for a variety of interface motions and shapes that include singularities, such as sharp corners and topology changes. Good convergence with respect to the grid spacing is obtained. Mass conservation is achieved without the use of separate re-initialization schemes or Lagrangian marker particles.

abstract = {The Cahn-Hilliard equation involves fourth-order spatial derivatives. Finite element solutions are not common because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are only well defined and integrable if the finite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally C1-continuous. There are a very limited number of two-dimensional finite elements possessing C1-continuity applicable to complex geometries, but none in three-dimensions. We propose isogeometric analysis as a technology that possesses a unique combination of attributes for complex problems involving higher-order differential operators, namely, higher-order accuracy, robustness, two- and three-dimensional geometric flexibility, compact support, and, most importantly, the possibility of C1 and higher-order continuity. A NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation was tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state solutions in two-dimensions and, for the first time, in three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping method is introduced. We also present a technique for desensitizing calculations to dependence on mesh refinement. This enables the calculation of topologically correct solutions on coarse meshes, opening the way to practical engineering applications of phase-field methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The phase-field method has recently emerged as a powerful computational approach to modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and microstructure evolution in materials. It describes a microstructure using a set of conserved and nonconserved field variables that are continuous across the interracial regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the field variables is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the Allen-Cahn relaxation equation. With the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures without explicitly tracking the positions of interfaces. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in developing phase-field models for various materials processes including solidification, solid-state structural phase transformations, grain growth and coarsening, domain evolution in thin films, pattern formation on surfaces, dislocation microstructures, crack propagation, and electromigration.},

abstract = {A theory of coarsening in an isothermal, ternary alloy is developed in an effort to understand the effects of a third chemical component on the ripening behavior of a two-phase system. The analysis is valid for a general, nonideal, nondilute solution, but is limited to extremely small volume fractions of the coarsening phase and neglects off-diagonal terms in the diffusion matrix. The Gibbs-Thompson equation in a ternary system undergoing coarsening reveals that the concentrations at the particle/matrix interface are dependent on the far-field supersaturations as well as on the particle radius. In addition, the capillary length depends on the diffusivities of the two components. An asymptotic analysis shows that the exponents of the temporal power laws for the average particle radius, number of particles per unit volume, and the matrix supersaturations are the same as that found in the binary limit; however, the amplitudes of the power laws are modified. We find that the trajectory of the matrix supersaturation must lie along a tie-line, but the trajectory of the particle composition does not. An expression for the effect of dilute ternary-additions to the coarsening rate of a binary alloy is also given.},

abstract = {Cobalt-based superalloys with two phase $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ microstructures offer great promise as candidates for next-generation high-temperature alloys for applications, such as turbine blades. It is essential to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence the microstructural evolution of these alloys in order to optimize the alloy compositions and processing steps with a goal to improve their coarsening, creep and rafting behavior. We are using a continuum phase field approach to study the diffusion process and to predict the equilibrium shapes of Co-Al-W $\gamma$′ precipitates. In order to obtain quantitatively predictive capabilities, we extract chemical free energies for the $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ phases based on CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) thermodynamic data and diffusion mobilities for Co alloys based on CALPHAD kinetic data. We also use experimental or first-principles data for other quantities, such as misfit strain and interface information, for the parameterization of our model. A particular focus of our study is to understand how different energy balances, misfit strain and kinetics affect the coarsening and rafting behavior of $\gamma$′ precipitates, and the sensitivity of the final precipitate shape to materials parameters. We find that the equilibrium shape of the precipitate results from a delicate competition between chemical, interfacial, and elastic energies, and it is very sensitive to changes in model parameters. We examine how modeling input parameters affect the equilibrium shape of precipitates and relate these parameters to experimentally available values.},

abstract = {We propose a model based on a phase-field approach to study the effect of the solute drag on moving grain boundaries in a binary alloy system. By considering the grain boundary as a distinguishable phase and adopting a "segregation potential" in the grain boundary region, the effect of solute drag is automatically incorporated into the model. It is shown at equilibrium that the model can reproduce the equilibrium solute segregation and Gibbs adsorption. It is also demonstrated at a one-dimensional steady state that the model includes both the solute drag proposed by Cahn and the free energy dissipation by Hillert and Sundman. In the dilute solution limit, the simple expressions for the concentration distribution around the interfacial region and the solute drag are obtained as functions of boundary velocity, diffusivity and segregation potential and they are found to be consistent with the previous theories for solute drag phenomenon. In two-dimensional quasi steady state, the phase field model reduces to the relationship between normal velocity and the curvature of the boundary and the relationship between phase field mobility and the grain boundary mobility is obtained. {\textcopyright} 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

@article{Rolchigo2022,
abstract = {Modeling the as-solidified grain structures that form during alloy processing is a critical component in understanding process-property relationships, particularly for additive manufacturing (AM) where grain structure is very sensitive to processing conditions. While cellular automata (CA)-based models have proven able to predict aspects of microstructure for several alloys and AM process conditions, long run times and large resource sets required limit the utility and the problem size to which existing CA models can be applied. As part of the ExaAM project, an initiative within the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) to develop, test, and optimize an exascale-capable coupled and self-consistent model of AM parts, we developed ExaCA (https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA) for the liquid–solid phase transformation in the wake of AM melt pools. The CA-based code is parallelized using MPI and the Kokkos programming model, the latter enabling simulation on both CPUs and GPUs within a single-source implementation. We detail the steps taken to transform a baseline, MPI-based CA code into one that is performant on CPUs and GPUs. Performance testing of ExaCA on Summit (a pre-exascale machine at Oak Ridge National Laboratory) was used to quantify CPU–GPU speedup comparing with equal numbers of nodes. Testing showed comparable CPU performance to the MPI-only CA code and a 5-20x speedup when running AM-based test problems using GPUs. The improved performance of CA through GPU utilization and the performance portable nature of ExaCA will enable accurate part-scale modeling by harnessing the power of current and future generations of high performance computing resources. Future work will include improving the strong scaling of ExaCA on GPUs by reducing load imbalance associated with the locality of the problem, and continuing performance optimization across exascale hardware.},

In quantitative modeling the assessment and compilation of thermodynamic/kinetic data is largely dominated by the CALPHAD approach, which has produced a large set of experimentally and computationally generated Gibbs free energy and atomic mobility data in a standardized format: the thermodynamic database (TDB) file format. Harnessing this data for the purpose of phase-field modeling is an ongoing effort encompassing a wide variety of approaches. In this paper, we aim to directly link CALPHAD data to the phase-field method, without intermediate fitting or interpolation steps. We introduce a model based on the Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) approach. This model includes sublattice site fractions and can directly utilize data from TDB files. Using this approach, we demonstrate the model on the U-Zr and Mo-Ni-Re systems.},

@article{Nani2022,
abstract = {Although multi-phase-field models are applied extensively to simulate various pattern formations, their asymptotic analysis is not typically performed at a level of rigor common to their scalar counterparts. Most of the time, arguments given, such as for the justification of the selection of the bulk phases or the phasal composition of the interfaces between them, are only heuristic in nature. In particular, the reduction of the multi-phase-field models to two-phase ones, so as to ascertain the dynamical laws captured by them, can only be termed as hand waving, at best. It is also common to land the starting point of the analysis directly at a point where the binary interfaces have already formed and continue therefrom with the prediction of their instantaneous evolution. However, exactly how a given initial filling transitions to a state characterized by the presence of bulk phases separated by internal layers, and with what distribution, is rarely addressed. Moreover, a detailed and systematic study, focused on the numerical realization of the asymptotics predicted laws, has never been reported before for multi-phase-field models. In the current article, endorsing against these undesirabilities of the common presentations, a full-fledged asymptotic analysis of a multi-grain-growth phase-field model is put forth and numerically verified. However, the consideration is only limited to the analysis of binary interfaces; that of junctions (triple points, quadruple points, etc.) is deferred to a later work.},

The model was applied to simulate the highly anisotropic dendritic solidification in an undercooled pure material (symmetric model) and in a supersaturated alloy (one-sided model). Simulation was performed under a wide range of anisotropy covering the critical anisotropy, where corners appear in the equilibrium crystal shape. The growth rate of dendrite increased monotonically with increase in the anisotropy when the anisotropy strength was lower than the critical value. As the anisotropy crossed the critical value, however, the growth rate dropped down by about 10%, and then increased again with higher anisotropy. The growth velocity reached a maximum value, followed by a slight decrease with further increase in the anisotropy. Overall behavior of the dendritic growth with corners seemed to be understood by considering the decreasing range of the allowed interface orientation with increase in the anisotropy beyond the critical value. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The finite solid–liquid interface width in phase field models results in non-equilibrium effects, including solute trapping. Prior phase field modeling has shown that this extra degree of freedom, when compared to sharp-interface models, results in solute trapping that is well captured when realistic parameters, such as interface width, are employed. However, increasing the interface width, which is desirable for computational reasons, leads to artificially enhanced trapping thus making it difficult to model departure from equilibrium quantitatively. In the present work, we develop a variational phase field model that guarantees a temporal decrease in the free energy with independent kinetic equations for the solid and liquid phases. Separate kinetic equations for the phase concentrations obviate the assumption of point wise equality of diffusion potentials, as is done in previous works. Non-equilibrium effects such as solute trapping, drag and interface kinetics can be introduced in a controlled manner in the present model. In addition, the model parameters can be tuned to obtain “experimentally-relevant” trapping while using significantly larger interface widths than prior efforts. A comparison with these other phase field models suggests that interface width of about three to twenty-five times larger than current best-in-class models can be employed depending upon the material system at hand leading to a speed-up by a factor of W(d+2), where W and d denote the interface width and spatial dimension, respectively. Finally the capacity to model non-equilibrium phenomena is demonstrated by simulating oscillatory instability leading to the formation of solute bands.},

abstract = {The solutions of multi-phase-field models exhibit boundary layer behavior not only along the binary interfaces but also at the common contacts of three or more phases, i.e., junctions. Hence, to completely determine the asymptotic behavior of a multi-phase-field model, the inner analysis of both types of layers has to be carried out, whereas, traditionally, the junctions part is ignored. This is remedied in the current work for a phase-field model of simple grain growth in two spatial dimensions. Since the junction neighbourhoods are fundamentally different from those of the binary interfaces, pertinent matching conditions had to be derived from scratch, which is also accomplished in a detailed manner. The leading-order matching analysis of the junctions exposed the restrictions present on the interfacial arrangement at the common meeting point, while the next-to-the-leading one uncovered the law governing the instantaneous motion of the latter. In particular, it is predicted for the considered model that the Young's law is always satisfied at a triple point, whether or not it is at rest. Surprisingly, the mobilities and the curvatures of the involving interfaces as well as the driving forces on the them do not affect this result. However, they do play a significant role in determining the instantaneous velocity of the junction point. The study has opened up many new directions for future research.},

abstract = {New perspectives on the phase field approach in modeling deformation and fracture at the fundamental defect level are reviewed. When applied at sub-angstrom length scales the phase field crystal (PFC) model is able to describe thermally averaged atomic configurations of defects and defect processes on diffusional timescales. When applied at individual defect levels the microscopic phase field (MPF) model is a superset of the Cahn-Hilliard description of chemical inhomogeneities and the Peierls (cohesive zone) description of displacive inhomogeneities. A unique feature associated with the MPF model is its ability to predict fundamental properties of individual defects such as size, formation energy, saddle point configuration and activation energy of defect nuclei, and the micromechanisms of their mutual interactions, directly using ab initio calculations as model inputs. When applied at the mesoscopic level the coarse grained phase field (CGPF) models have the ability to predict the evolution of microstructures consisting of a large assembly of both chemically and mechanically interacting defects through coupled displacive and diffusional mechanisms. It is noted that the purpose of the MPF model is fundamentally different from that of the CGPF models. The latter have been used primarily to study microstructural evolution with user-supplied linear response rate laws, defect energies and mobilities. Combined phase field simulations hold great promise in modeling deformation and fracture with complex microstructural and chemical interactions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

@article{Teferra2021,
abstract = {This study proposes an implementation of the cellular automata finite element (CAFE) model in order to optimize its performance for simulating the solidification of additively manufactured (AM) materials. The translating melt pool in AM leads to a highly localized region of activity at any given time. The time scale associated with the evolving temperature field is much larger than the time scale associated with grain solidification. A separation of temporal scales is proposed such that solidification analysis is treated independently as sub-cycles within each discrete time step of the scanning laser. At each laser time step, all of the domain is idle except a small portion, which is the region where the material is undercooled but has yet to be solidified. This region is identified, and a second partition of the computational resources is established such that the solidification computations are evenly balanced. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed implementation achieves dramatic improvement in parallel scalability than previously reported and thus advances the state-of-the-art of CAFE modeling for AM in terms of computational efficiency. This improved computational performance is necessary to simulate the large 3D polycrystalline microstructures required to evaluate texture and grain morphology, and two of such simulations are presented. The model is validated for laser powder bed fusion 316L stainless steel, where the polycrystalline grain morphology and crystallographic texture of the simulated microstructure closely match experimental characterization data. A second simulation is performed for a different scan pattern in order to highlight and evaluate its effect on microstructural features.},

By defining the interfacial region as a mixture of solid and liquid with the same inter-diffusion potential and determining and matching the phase-field parameters to the alloy properties at a thin-interface limit condition, the limit of interface thickness due to the contribution of the chemical free energy density in the interfacial region is remarkably relieved and a large-scale calculation domain is permitted. One-dimensional numerical calculations for the solidification of an dilute Fe-Mn-C alloy system demonstrate that the model could provide a good description for the equilibrium and kinetic properties for isothermal solidification of multicomponent alloys.

abstract = {Most phase-field models (PFMs) for diffusional phase transformation in alloys employ the equal diffusion potential (EDP) condition to eliminate the contribution of bulk free energies to the interface energy. For engineering alloys where their thermodynamic properties are often given by a very complex database, however, solving the EDP condition can substantially limit the computational efficiency of the PFMs. In this study, we present a method to effectively solve the EDP condition. By modifying the PFM with finite interface dissipation, a relaxation equation for the partition coefficient is extracted. We adopt this relaxation equation to replace the EDP condition in a conventional PFM. This relaxation equation is straightforwardly extended to a multicomponent and multiphase system. The relaxation equation for dilute ideal alloys appears to be fully independent of the phase field and the diffusion field, so it can be analytically solved. We obtain a criterion for the relaxation parameter to effectively maintain the EDP condition in the interfacial region. Using the PFM coupled with the relaxation equation, we simulate the dendritic growth in an Al-Si alloy with a full thermodynamic database and compare the results with the predictions obtained from the relaxation equation. The relaxation kinetics in the simulations are in excellent agreement with the predictions. We apply the present PFM to simulate the microstructure evolution for early stage solidification during continuous casting of a quaternary steel alloy under real process conditions. We systemically examine the effects of the relaxation parameter. The present criterion for the choice of the relaxation parameter can be used for multicomponent nondilute alloys.},

The phase-field and diffusion equations, derived from a free energy functional, are compared to those postulated in the previous model in the limit of a binary alloy. The constraint of local quasiequilibrium, which is equivalent to the postulate of equal diffusion potentials for coexisting phases, is deduced from a variational principle. Solute partitioning and evaluation of the thermodynamic driving force for phase transformation are done by numerical minimization of the free energy of the multiphase system using the Calphad approach. A local extrapolation scheme which enhances the computational efficiency for complex numerical simulations of technical alloys is presented.

In the following, we extend this latter approach for multi-component alloys in the framework of the grand-potential formalism. The coupling is applied for the case of the binary eutectic solidification in the Cr-Ni alloy and two-phase solidification in the ternary eutectic alloy (Al-Cr-Ni).

abstract = {There is growing interest in applying phase field methods as quantitative tools in materials discovery and development. However, large driving forces, common in many materials systems, lead to unstable phase field profiles, thus requiring fine spatial and temporal resolution. This demands more computational resources, limits the ability to simulate systems with a suitable size, and deteriorates the capability of quantitative prediction. Here, we develop a strategy to map the driving force to a constant perpendicular to the interface. Together with the third-order interpolation function, we find a stable phase field profile that is independent of the magnitude of the driving force. The power of this approach is illustrated using three models. We demonstrate that by using the driving force extension method, it is possible to employ a grid size orders of magnitude larger than traditional methods. This approach is general and should apply to many other phase field models.},

Next, we carry out phase-field simulations to test our analytic predictions and to study the instabilities of the simplest periodic lamellar arrays. For large spacings, we observe different oscillatory modes that are similar to those found previously for binary eutectics and that can be classified using the symmetry elements of the steady-state pattern.

The effects of Ni/Al concentrations and magnetic interactions on the kinetics of Cu-rich phase formation and component distribution features were systematically studied. Simulated atom maps indicate that the Cu-rich phase possessed a complex core−shell structure consisting of a BCC Cu-rich core and a B2 Ni/Al/Mn-rich shell. Ni/Al/Mn-rich shells could be regarded as a buffer layer hindering Cu cluster formation and also as a diffusion channel connecting neighboring small particles, thus influencing the precipitation of the Cu-rich phase. It was found from the analyses of volume fraction and particle size distribution that the deviation between the proposed coarsening law and the theoretical LSW theory occurred due to the inhibiting effect of Ni–Al–Mn shells and the mixed coarsening mechanism of coalescence and Ostwald ripening. High Ni/Al contents and magnetic interactions obstructed the phase separation, growth and coarsening of the Cu-rich phase, thus leading to particle refinement and the clustering of Ni–Al–Mn atoms. Therefore, the obtained results can provide useful information for the preparation of Fe–Cu–Mn–Ni–Al alloy.},

Our results are consistent with the scaling predictions of the classical Jackson and Hunt theory of eutectic lamellae.

abstract = {Sharp-interface and thin-interface asymptotic analyses are presented for a generalization of the Beckermann-Karma phase-field model for solidification of a dilute binary alloy when the interface curvature is macroscopic. The ratio of diffusivities, Rm ≡ Ds′ / Dm′, in the solid and melt is arbitrary with 0 {less-than or slanted equal to} Rm {less-than or slanted equal to} 1. Discrepancies between this diffuse-interface model and the classical, two sided solutal model (TSM) description are quantified up to second order in the small parameter $\epsilon${lunate} that controls the interface thickness. We uncover extra terms in the interface species flux balance and in the Gibbs-Thomson equilibrium condition introduced by the finite width of the interface. Asymptotic results in the limit of rapid-interfacial kinetics are presented for both finite phase-field mobility and a quasi-steady state approximation for the phase-field wherein the phase-field responds passively to the concentration field. The possibility of adding additional terms to the phase-field version of the species conservation equation is explored as a means of achieving O ( $\epsilon${lunate}2 ) consistency with the classical model. Our results naturally lead to a generalization of the anti-trapping solutal flux suggested by Karma [Phase-field-formulation for quantitative modeling of alloy solidification, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87(11) (2001) 115701] for the limit Rm = 0. Achieving second order accuracy for arbitrary Rm requires judicious choices for the interpolating functions; these are calculated a posteriori using the functional forms of the error terms as a guide. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A unified thermodynamic description of moving non-equilibrium interfaces is developed for both solid/solid and solid/liquid transformations. The theory is applicable to concentrated multicomponent alloys where diffusion is possible in both phases or in just the parent phase, and where energy is dissipated due to solute drag. To be consistent with energy dissipation, we find that solute drag affects both the velocity of the interface and distribution coefficients for the compositions of the two phases at the interface. In the limit of binary alloy solidification, the theory predicts significant changes in the interfacial compositions from that given by the equilibrium phase diagram at velocities commonly found during additive manufacturing. Since the distribution coefficient is affected by solute drag, the solute-trapping behavior observed in molecular dynamics simulations implies that the interfacial diffusivity lies between the diffusivity of the bulk solid and liquid. A comparison to past work on non-equilibrium interfaces during solid/solid and solid/liquid phase transformations is also given.},

abstract = {In rapid phase transformations, interfaces are often driven far from equilibrium, and the chemical potential may exhibit a jump across the interface. We develop a model for the description of such situations in the framework of the phase-field formalism, with separate concentration fields in each phase. The key novel feature of this model is that the two concentration fields are linked by a kinetic equation which describes the exchange of components between the phases, instead of an equilibrium partitioning condition. The associated rate constant influences the interface dissipation. For rapid exchange between the phases, the chemical potentials are equal in both coexisting phases at the interface as in previous models, whereas in the opposite limit strong non-equilibrium behavior can be modeled. This is illustrated by simulations of a diffusion couple and of solute trapping during rapid solidification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The overall mass conservation between the phases of a multiple junction is used in model I, whereas the concentrations of each pair of phases have to be conserved during the transformations for model II.

abstract = {A continuum phase field theory and corresponding numerical solution methods are developed to describe deformation twinning in crystalline solids. An order parameter is associated with the magnitude of twinning shear, i.e., the lattice transformation associated with twinning. The general theory addresses the following physics: large deformations, nonlinear anisotropic elastic behavior, and anisotropic phase boundary energy. The theory is applied towards prediction of equilibrium phenomena in the athermal and non-dissipative limit, whereby equilibrium configurations of an externally stressed crystal are obtained via incremental minimization of a free energy functional. Outcomes of such calculations are elastic fields (e.g., displacement, strain, stress, and strain energy density) and the order parameter field that describes the size and shape of energetically stable twin(s). Numerical simulations of homogeneous twin nucleation in magnesium single crystals demonstrate fair agreement between phase field solutions and available analytical elasticity solutions. Results suggest that critical far-field displacement gradients associated with nucleation of a twin embryo of minimum realistic size are 4.5%5.0%, with particular values of applied shear strain and equilibrium shapes of the twin somewhat sensitive to far-field boundary conditions and anisotropy of twin boundary surface energy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Solidification is an important process in many alloy processing routes. The solidified microstructure of alloys is usually made up of dendrites, eutectics or a combination of both. The evolving morphologies are largely determined by the solidification process and thus many materials properties are dependent on the processing conditions. While the growth of either type of microstructure is well-investigated, there is little information on the coupled growth of both microstructures. This work aims to close this gap by formulating a phase-field model capable of reproducing dendritic, eutectic as well as dendritic–eutectic growth. Following this, two-dimensional simulations are conducted which show all three types of microstructures depending on the composition and processing conditions. The effect of the dendritic–eutectic growth on the microstructural lengths, which determine materials properties, is investigated and the morphological hysteresis between eutectic growth and dendritic–eutectic growth is studied by employing solidification velocity jumps. Finally, qualitative three-dimensional simulations are conducted to test for morphological changes in the eutectic.},

We identify three stages of temporal evolution for the governing equations: the first corresponds to interfacial genesis, which occurs very rapidly; the second to interfacial motion controlled by diffusion and the local energy difference across the interface; the last takes place on a long time scale in which curvature effects are important, and corresponds to Ostwald ripening.

The model reproduces the analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions, has no anomalous trijunction drag, and Wulff shapes for cubic grain boundary energy anisotropy. Polycrystalline simulations in two dimensions demonstrate a pronounced effect of low angle grain boundaries on the microstructure evolution, demonstrating the importance of accounting for misorientation-dependent energy, particularly in highly textured materials. This model serves as a simple, computationally efficient, and physics-based method for simulating grain growth phenomena. With the ability to tune the grain boundary energy and mobility, the model shows promise for use in large scale simulations of grain coarsening in a wide range of systems.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional directional solidification problem is considered for the purpose of analyzing the relationship between the solution resulting from a phase-field model to that from a sharp-interface model. The solidification problem is posed within a finite domain, rather than an infinite extent, as in classical Stefan problems. An asymptotic analysis based upon a small Stefan number is performed on the sharp-interface model. In the phase-field case, the small Stefan number expansion is coupled with a small interface-thickness boundary layer expansion. This approach enables us to develop analytical solutions to the phase-field model. The results show agreement at leading order between the two models for the location of the solidification front and the temperature profiles in the solid and liquid phases. However, due to the nonzero interface thickness in the phase-field model, corrections to the sharp-interface location and temperature profiles develop. These corrections result from the conduction of latent heat across the diffuse interface. The magnitude of these corrections increases with the speed of the front due to the corresponding increase in the release of latent heat. Following Karma and Rappel [Phys. Rev. E (3), 57 (1998), pp. 4323-4349] and Almgren [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 59 (1999), pp. 2086-2107], we select the coupling between the order parameter and the temperature in the phase-field model and select the kinetic coefficient to eliminate the corrections to second order. Hence the phase-field temperature profiles agree with the sharp-interface profiles, except near the solidification front, where there is smoothing over the diffuse interface and no jump in the temperature gradients. {\textcopyright} 2001 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {We present a detailed derivation and thin interface analysis of a phase-field model that can accurately simulate microstructural pattern formation for low-speed directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy. This advance with respect to previous phase-field models is achieved by the addition of a phenomenological “antitrapping” solute current in the mass conservation relation [A. Karma, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 115701 (2001)]. This antitrapping current counterbalances the physical, albeit artificially large, solute trapping effect generated when a mesoscopic interface thickness is used to simulate the interface evolution on experimental length and time scales. Furthermore, it provides additional freedom in the model to suppress other spurious effects that scale with this thickness when the diffusivity is unequal in solid and liquid [R. F. Almgren, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 59, 2086 (1999)], which include surface diffusion and a curvature correction to the Stefan condition. This freedom can also be exploited to make the kinetic undercooling of the interface arbitrarily small even for mesoscopic values of both the interface thickness and the phase-field relaxation time, as for the solidification of pure melts [A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)]. The performance of the model is demonstrated by calculating accurately within a phase-field approach the Mullins-Sekerka stability spectrum of a planar interface and nonlinear cellular shapes for realistic alloy parameters and growth conditions. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface PFM are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions.

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the derivation of a model for the simulation of phase transformations in multicomponent real alloys starting from a grand-potential functional. We first point out the limitations of a phase-field model when evolution equations for the concentration and the phase-field variables are derived from a free energy functional. These limitations are mainly attributed to the contribution of the grand-chemical-potential excess to the interface energy. For a range of applications, the magnitude of this excess becomes large and its influence on interface profiles and dynamics is not negligible. The related constraint regarding the choice of the interface thickness limits the size of the domain that can be simulated and, hence, the effect of larger scales on microstructure evolution can not be observed. We propose a modification to the model in order to decouple the bulk and interface contributions. Following this, we perform the thin-interface asymptotic analysis of the phase-field model. Through this, we determine the thin-interface kinetic coefficient and the antitrapping current to remove the chemical potential jump at the interface. We limit our analysis to the Stefan condition at lowest order in $\epsilon$ (parameter related to the interface width) and apply results from previous literature that the corrections to the Stefan condition (surface diffusion and interface stretching) at higher orders are removed when antisymmetric interpolation functions are used for interpolating the grand-potential densities and the diffusion mobilities. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

In this context, thermomechanical coupling is often neglected, even when non-isothermal phase transformations are considered. Using a simplified example, the present work shows that this assumption is not justified for small strains and small strain rates with respect to a non-vanishing coefficient of thermal expansion. To this end, both a thermomechanically coupled and a thermomechanically weakly coupled theory are briefly revisited. The difference between the coupled and the weakly coupled theory regarding the growth of an inclusion is discussed. The considered elastoplastic inclusion, subjected to eigenstrains, is embedded in an elastoplastic matrix under load. It is shown, that the weakly coupled theory overestimates the growth of the inclusion, and, thus, the volume concentration, compared to the coupled theory. Moreover, only the application of the coupled theory reflects a load-induced anisotropic growth of the inclusion, which exhibits an isotropic material behavior, due to non-vanishing uniaxial Neumann boundary conditions. In addition, it is shown that the smaller the heat conduction coefficient, the more pronounced the anisotropic growth of the inclusion.},

These simulations exploit a recently developed thin-interface limit of the phase-field model [A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)], which is given here a detailed exposition. This limit makes it possible to perform efficient computations with a smaller ratio of capillary length to interface thickness and with an arbitrary interface kinetic coefficient. Simulations in one and two dimensions are first carried out to test the accuracy of phase-field computations performed within this limit. Dendrite tip velocities and tip shapes are found to be in excellent quantitative agreement with exact numerical benchmarks of solvability theory obtained by a boundary integral method, both with and without interface kinetics. Simulations in three dimensions exploit, in addition to the asymptotics, a methodology to calculate grid corrections due to the surface tension and kinetic anisotropies. They are used to test basic aspects of dendritic growth theory that pertain to the selection of the operating state of the tip and to the three-dimensional morphology of needle crystals without sidebranches. For small crystalline anisotropy, simulated values of [formula presented] are slightly larger than solvability theory predictions computed by the boundary integral method assuming an axisymmetric shape, and agree relatively well with experiments for succinonitrile given the uncertainty in the measured anisotropy. In contrast, for large anisotropy, simulated [formula presented] values are significantly larger than the predicted values. This disagreement, however, does not signal a breakdown of solvability theory. It is consistent with the finding that the amplitude of the [formula presented] mode, which measures the departure of the tip morphology from a shape of revolution, increases with anisotropy. This departure can therefore influence the tip selection in a way that is not accurately captured by the axisymmetric approximation for large anisotropy. Finally, the tail shape at a distance behind the tip that is large compared to the diffusion length is described by a linear law [formula presented] with a slope [formula presented] that is nearly equal to the ratio of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional steady-state tip velocities. Furthermore, the evolution of the cross section of a three-dimensional needle crystal with increasing distance behind the tip is nearly identical to the evolution of a two-dimensional growth shape in time, in accord with the current theory of the three-dimensional needle crystal shape. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

The dual-phase ($\gamma$-austenite and B2 intermetallic compound) HSSS possesses high yield strength of 1.2-1.4 GPa and uniform elongation of 18-34%. The tensile deformation of the HSSS exhibits an initial yield-peak, followed by a transient characterized by an up-turn of the strain hardening rate. Using synchrotron based high-energy in situ X-ray diffraction, the evolution of lattice strains in both the $\gamma$ and B2 phases was monitored, which has disclosed an explicit elasto-plastic transition through load transfer and strain partitioning between the two phases followed by co-deformation. The unloading-reloading tests revealed the Bauschinger effect: During unloading yield in $\gamma$ occurs even when the applied load is still in tension. The extraordinary strain hardening rate can be attributed to the high back stresses that arise from the strain incompatibility caused by the microstructural heterogeneity in the HSSS.},

abstract = {A high-Mn high-Al steel generally exhibits ultra-high ductility but low yield strength. Here, we report a way to control the precipitation of B2 and $\kappa$-carbide via annealing and subsequent aging in a Fe-16Mn-9Al-0.8C-3Ni (wt%) steel. The main purpose is to acquire refined and homogeneously distributed B2 and $\kappa$-carbide simultaneously so as to improve the strength–ductility balance. The microstructure of annealed sample consists of austenite, micron-sized polygonal B2 along austenite grain boundaries (GB-B2) and intra-granular B2 (mainly concentrates at 300–600 nm) in austenite (IG-B2). Aging results in high-density and fine IG-B2 particles (mostly smaller than 300 nm) and nano-scaled $\kappa$-carbides in austenite. Besides, a large amount of 30–220 nm sized $\kappa$-carbide precipitates within GB-B2 after aging at 600°C for 5 min. As a result, the precipitation strengthening of IG-B2 and $\kappa$-carbide particles as well as additional order strengthening of nano-scaled $\kappa$-carbides in austenite can dramatically increase yield strength by approximately 40% ($\sim$300 MPa) with no deterioration of ductility. However, a longer aging time (60 min) not only coarsens the $\kappa$-carbides to 55–280 nm, but also leads to the precipitation of new $\kappa$-carbides (150–730 nm) at B2-austenite interface due to eutectoid reaction, which can seriously worsen ductility.},

At 720 °C, nanosized B2-particles of different morphologies were formed inside austenite and ferrite grains. After annealing at 1050 °C the selected area diffraction (SAED) and HAADF analysis confirmed the formation of rod-shaped ordered Ni3Al-type particles of FCC crystal structure on the (111) plane of austenite grains. Moreover, inside the ferrite grains, new austenite grains up to 30 $\mu$m in size were observed. Ordered Ni3Al-type rod and spherical shape particles contributed to an increase of 7% in the average ultimate tensile strength due to hindering of dislocations movement on the active slip plane of austenite grains. A significant increase of 233% in average elongation to failure was also achieved with high-temperature annealing due to the evolution of new austenite grains and the disappearance of B2 particles. The presence of fibrous dimple fracture in the sample annealed at 1050 °C is consistent with the high ductility observed. This is in stark comparison to the sample annealed at 720 °C which showed failure through ductile tearing and cleavage.},

The tensile properties of the samples annealed differently have been studied and correlated with the microstructure. After annealing at 480 °C, $\kappa$-carbides were observed inside the austenite grain along with the presence of DO3 adjoining austenite. However, after annealing at 840 °C ordered-particles with two different morphologies (fine spheres and rod-shaped) were formed inside the ferrite grains and needle-shaped particles were formed inside the austenite grains. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) analysis suggested that the Fe-Mn type B2-particles were formed inside the ferrite grains whereas Ni-Al type B2-particles were formed inside the austenite grains. The samples annealed at 840 °C showed higher strength and ductility but the sample annealed at 480 °C showed high strain hardening.

In the as-annealed condition, the microstructure of the steel consists of polygonal B2 particles along grain boundaries of recrystallized austenite grains and plate-shape B2 particles within unrecrystallized austenite grains, with no B2 bands. In addition, there is a formation of nano-sized $\kappa$-carbide and D03 particles within austenite grains and B2 particles, respectively. Subsequent aging promotes the formation of intragranular $\kappa$-carbide and D03 nanoparticles within austenite grains and B2 particles, respectively. As a result, the present steel shows an ultrahigh yield strength of 1.6 GPa after aging, which is mainly due to the presence of fine B2 particles within austenite grains and along grain boundaries as well as the additional strengthening effect of nano-sized $\kappa$-carbide and D03 particles present in austenite grains and B2 particles, respectively. The steel possesses good ductility (total elongation of 20%) even at such an ultrahigh strength level in the as-aged condition, surpassing the tensile properties of other B2 and $\kappa$-carbide strengthened lightweight steels.},

abstract = {Although steel has been the workhorse of the automotive industry since the 1920s, the share by weight of steel and iron in an average light vehicle is now gradually decreasing, from 68.1 per cent in 1995 to 60.1 per cent in 2011 (refs 1, 2). This has been driven by the low strength-to-weight ratio (specific strength) of iron and steel, and the desire to improve such mechanical properties with other materials. Recently, high-aluminium low-density steels have been actively studied as a means of increasing the specific strength of an alloy by reducing its density. But with increasing aluminium content a problem is encountered: brittle intermetallic compounds can form in the resulting alloys, leading to poor ductility. Here we show that an FeAl-type brittle but hard intermetallic compound (B2) can be effectively used as a strengthening second phase in high-aluminium low-density steel, while alleviating its harmful effect on ductility by controlling its morphology and dispersion. The specific tensile strength and ductility of the developed steel improve on those of the lightest and strongest metallic materials known, titanium alloys. We found that alloying of nickel catalyses the precipitation of nanometre-sized B2 particles in the face-centred cubic matrix of high-aluminium low-density steel during heat treatment of cold-rolled sheet steel. Our results demonstrate how intermetallic compounds can be harnessed in the alloy design of lightweight steels for structural applications and others.},

Upon exposure to high temperatures of 1110°C for 30 min, the B2 phase coarsens, reaching a size of $\sim$ 26 nm while still positioned within the BCC phase. It further disintegrates into $\sim$ 6-nm-sized precipitates upon annealing at 1200°C for 30 min indicating the limited stability of the B2 phase. Thermodynamic phase analysis also supports the above observation of decreasing B2 phase stability with increasing temperature beyond 1100°C. In addition, APT also revealed the presence of $\kappa$-precipitates localized within the majority $\gamma$ matrix. The collective contribution of $\kappa$, B2 and A2 phases strengthens the majority $\gamma$ matrix of the hot-rolled steel, resulting in achieving an ultimate tensile strength in excess of 1.2 GPa with an extended ductility of $\sim$34% at room temperature.},

We investigate the effects of annealing temperature from 500 °C to 1050 °C on the precipitation of ordered phases size and morphology through phase-field modelling and experimental studies based on laboratory scale annealing and characterization. The chemical composition of carbides and B2 compounds as a function of isothermal annealing temperature and the matrix within which they formed are elucidated in this study. It is found that nano-sized disk-shaped B2 particles form at higher annealing temperatures (e.g. 900 °C and 1050 °C). The simulation results on carbides demonstrated the effects of energetic competition between interfacial energy and elastic strain energy on the morphological evolution of carbides. In addition to that, different ordering behaviours observed depending on the Ni content into the steel. The results demonstrate processing route designed through the phase-field simulations led to a better combination of strength and ductility. The tensile testing results indicate an increase in the strength and elongation when B2 precipitate morphology changes from micro-size faceted shape to nano-size disk-like particles.},

abstract = {Controlling morphology of B2 phase as nano-sized particles that are homogenously distributed within austenite matrix has been remained as a challenging task particularly for hot rolled lightweight steels, where the nucleation sites for B2 precipitation are less abundant than in cold rolled ones. Utilizing the phenomena occurring in age-hardenable aluminum alloys, i.e., heterogeneous nucleation of precipitates from pre-existing GP zones, here we solved this challenge by using $\kappa$-carbide nanoparticles to promote the formation and to engineer the morphology of B2. This strategy has been applied to a hot rolled Fe-21Mn-10Al-1C-5Ni model steel resulting in the formation of a large fraction of B2 nanoparticles (sizes of 20-500 nm) uniformly distributed within austenite grains. Besides their contribution to precipitation strengthening, these B2 nanoparticles lead to a dramatic improvement of work hardening capability of the steel. As a result, novel precipitation hardened hot rolled lightweight steel with excellent combination of ultrahigh specific strength and ductility has been fabricated. Such properties of the present steel are not only better than those of other hot rolled lightweight steels strengthened by B2 and/or $\kappa$-carbide but also comparable to those of the steels subjected to additional cold rolling, and it is expected to expand the applications of B2-strengthened steels in response to an increasing demand for lightweight constructions.},
