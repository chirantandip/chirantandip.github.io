I am a PhD Student and my research is centered around solidification of metals and alloys. I write large C++ programs that approximately solves the partial-differential-equations that govern solidification and other relevant phenomenon like fluid flow, heat transfer etc.

As of yet, I have majorly worked on the Phase-Field simulations [(What is Phase-Field?)](notes/pfm_intro.html). More specifically, I have developed a GPU solver for the Kim-Kim-Suzuki equations, as my M.tech thesis, which you can find [here](projects/ug_kks_sycl.html).

My major interests are Complex-Systems and Multi-Physics simulations.
