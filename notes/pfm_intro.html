<blockquote>
<p>This chapter is a compilation of the fundamental concepts in Phase-Field Theory. (The Notes are still in making).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The phase-field is a thermodynamics-based method mostly used to model phase changes and microstructure evolution in materials. It is a mesoscopic method, meaning intermediate size. It deals with material systems between the nano-scale and a few micrometers. The variables used can be abstract non-conserved quantities representing a phase or anything (for example, a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> is a solid, <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> is a liquid and <span class="math inline">\(x \in (0,1)\)</span> is an interface between the two), or they can be conserved measurable quantity such as concentration.</p>
<p>The principle variable in such a model, that determines the state of a system is called and order parameter.</p>
<p>The state of a system is captured in a variable, which is most often a scalar field, a continuous function of position and time, and that represents a property of the system such as concentration or phase identity. Such a variable is called an Order parameter, and let’s denote it with <span class="math inline">\(\phi(r,t)\)</span>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> at each position and time is determined from the free energy of the system. If in addition of energy conservation, <span class="math inline">\(\phi(r,t)\)</span> must itself remain conserved throughout its time evolution, it is called a conserved order parameter, for example the concentration field is conserved by the law of conservation of mass. Parameters like phase identity, grain orientation etc. that do not obey any conservation law are called non-conserved order parameters.</p>
<p>The time evolution of a both kinds of order parameters are governed by two different equations.</p>
<h3 id="the-allen-cahn-equation">The Allen-Cahn equation</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> be the non-conserved order parameter. The free energy density of a phase can be expressed as a function <span class="math inline">\(f(\phi)\)</span> which depends only on the state of the system (T and P) at each point. Each value of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> represents a phase, let’s say <span class="math inline">\(\phi=0\)</span> is solid and <span class="math inline">\(\phi=1\)</span> is liquid, then only at the solid-liquid interface <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> will have a non-zero gradient. In this method, interfaces between phases are detected by taking the gradient of the order parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>.</p>
<p>The total energy of the system is a sum of both bulk and interfacial energy. Bulk energy distribution is given by a function <span class="math inline">\(f(\phi)\)</span> and the interfacial energy is assumed to vary linearly with <span class="math inline">\(|\nabla\phi|^2\)</span>. Higher the gradient of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, more discontinuous the interface and higher the interfacial energy. The free energy functional is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F = \int_V \left[ f(\phi) + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left|\nabla\phi \right|^2 \right] dv\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the constant that determines the interfacial free energy. The functional represents the volumetric total of the free energy of the system. And what should happen to the total free energy as time goes by, it should decrease. So, at equilibrium, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> should be in its minimum value, and the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> that minimizes <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> at equilibrium. That is the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> we are looking for. Now, how to minimize a functional, equate its derivative to 0, yes. But, taking the derivative of a functional has to do with the calculus of variations and is beyond the scope of the present work.</p>
<p>The differential equation obtained as a result of minimizing the total free energy of the system is called the Allen-Cahn equation. This equation governs the evolution of a non-conserved order parameter. It is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial \phi(r,t)}{\partial t} = -L_\phi \left[ \frac{\partial f(\phi)}{\partial \phi} - \epsilon \nabla^2 \phi(r,t) \right]\]</span></p>
<p>here <span class="math inline">\(L_\phi\)</span> is a constant. The key assumptions for this equation to hold are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interfaces are diffuse. <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> has continuous values across them.</li>
<li>The Higher-order terms in the taylor expansion of the free energy density <span class="math inline">\(f(\phi)\)</span> are negligible.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> will change with time to decrease the total free energy of the system.</li>
<li>Thermodynamics is the only driving force for change. No other forces like electromagnetism are at play.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are also a must for the evolution of conserved order parameters as well.</p>
<h3 id="the-cahn-hilliard-equation">The Cahn-Hilliard equation</h3>
<p>A conserved order parameter demands a conservation law to be imposed on top of the condition of total free energy minimization of the system. The conservation of most quantities are governed by the mathematical laws as those of mass conservation, namely the Fick’s laws of diffusion which are expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = -\nabla J \hspace{1cm}: J = -M\nabla \mu \hspace{1cm}\]</span></p>
<p>where J is the mass flux, M is the mobility of the material and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the chemical potential which is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu = \frac{\partial f(\phi)}{\partial \phi} - \epsilon \nabla^2 \phi(r,t)\]</span></p>
<p>Combining the two conditions, one can derive the differential equation governing the time evolution of a conserved order parameter, which is the Cahn-Hlliard equation. It is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial\phi(r,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla . \left( M \nabla . \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi} - \epsilon \nabla^2 \phi \right) \right)\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the mobility and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> determines the interfacial free energy. <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> can be taken out of the gradient operator when it is a scalar and then we will get a laplacian operating on the inner brackets.</p>
<h2 id="kobayashi-dendrite-growth">Kobayashi dendrite growth</h2>
<p>The simplest of all is the renowned work of Kobayashi<span class="citation" data-cites="Kobayashi1993"><sup><a href="#ref-Kobayashi1993" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> which is one of the earliest phase-field models for dendritic solidification.</p>
<p>The model includes two order parameters. One is a non-conserved order parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi(r,t)\)</span> which takes the value of 1 in solid phase and 0 in liquid phase. The other parameter is the temperature field <span class="math inline">\(T(r,t)\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the spatial position and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is time.</p>
<p>The free energy functional chosen for this model is the Ginzburg-Landau type free energy including <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> as a parameter :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(\phi,m) = \int_V \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^2 |\nabla \phi|^2 + f(\phi,m)dv ;\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a small parameter which determines the thickness of the layer and also controls the mobility of the interface. <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a double well potential (free energy function) that has local minima at <span class="math inline">\(\phi=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi=1\)</span> for each value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The specific form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> taken in this model is :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\phi,m) = \frac{1}{4}\phi^4 + (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}m)\phi^3 + (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2}m)\phi^2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(|m|&lt;\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. Anisotropy is accounted for by assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> depends on the direction of the outer normal vector at the interface. Its value is calculated as :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon = \bar{\epsilon}\sigma(\theta)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\epsilon}\)</span> is the mean value and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(\theta)\)</span> represents anisotropy in the form :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma(\theta) = 1 + \delta \cos{j(\theta - \theta_0)} \; \; \text{ with } \; \; \theta = \arctan{ \left(\frac{\partial \phi / \partial y}{\partial \phi/ \partial x} \right)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the strength of anisotropy and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is the mode number of anisotropy which takes the value of 4 for cubic lattices and 6 for hexagonal lattices. <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> is the initial offset angle taken as a constant.</p>
<p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is assumed to be dependent on the degree of supercooling an the temperature. The dependency is expressed as :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m(T) = \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \arctan{[ \gamma (T_{eq}-T } ]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a positive constant and <span class="math inline">\(T_{eq}\)</span> is the equilibrium temperature. The Allen-Cahn equation for the evolution of the non-conserved order parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> takes the respective forms as expressed above.</p>
<p>The temperature field evolution equation is derived from enthalpy conservation and is expressed as :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla^2T + \kappa\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\]</span></p>
<p>The equation is non-dimentionalized so that the characteristic cooling temperature is 0 and the equilibrium temperature is 1.</p>
<p>The isotropic phase field evolution equation is :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} =  \epsilon^2\nabla^2\phi + \phi(1-\phi)(\phi- \frac{1}{2} +m )\]</span></p>
<p>The phase field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> evolution equation for anisotropic solidification is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \epsilon \frac{\partial\epsilon}{\partial\theta} \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x} \right)- \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \epsilon \frac{\partial\epsilon}{\partial\theta} \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y} \right) + \nabla . (\epsilon^2\nabla\phi) + \phi(1-\phi)(\phi -\frac{1}{2} +m)\]</span></p>
<p>This model is henceforth referred to as ‘KOB’.</p>
<h2 id="the-wbm-model">The WBM Model</h2>
<p>The next important advance was made by Wheeler, Boettinger and McFadden<span class="citation" data-cites="Wheeler1992"><sup><a href="#ref-Wheeler1992" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span> and the model came to be known as WBM. The model describes isothermal phase transitions between ideal binary-alloy liquid and solid phases.</p>
<p>Extending on the KOB model, the free energy of an isothermal solid solution in which the two solutes are assumed to be ideal solutions is derived. It is assumed that the freezing temperature of the solution is between the freezing temperatures of the pure elements (a lens phase diagram). Further, the Helmholtz free energy of the components are assumed to be of the form :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_A(\phi; T) = W_A \int_0^{\phi} p(p-1)\left[p - \frac{1}{2} - \beta_A(T)\right] dp,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W_A\)</span> is a constant, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a isothermal parameter and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_A(T)\)</span> is a monotonically increasing function of temperature capturing the effects of undercooling. The free energy density of the solution is derived to be :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\phi, c; T) = cf_B + (1 - c) f_A + \frac{RT}{v_m} \left[ c \ln c + (1 - c) \ln (1 - c) \right]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the universal gas constant and <span class="math inline">\(v_m\)</span> is the molar volume assumed to be a constant. The free energy functional defined in terms of above equation is :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F[\phi, c; T] = \int_{V} \left[ f(\phi, c; T) + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2} |\nabla \phi|^2 \right] dv
\label{eq:wbmF}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the variational derivative of the free energy functional gives the following governing equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = M_1 \left[ \epsilon^2 \nabla^2 \phi - \left( c \frac{\partial f_B}{\partial \phi} + (1-c) \frac{\partial f_A}{\partial \phi} \right) \right]\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = M_2 \nabla \cdot \left[ c(1 - c) \nabla (f_B - f_A) \right] + D \nabla^2 c\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D=M_2RT/v_m\)</span> is the diffusivity of the solute <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> assumed to be constant and equal in both solid and liquid. And <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> are constants related to mobilities of phase and concentration fields.</p>
<p>The model can reproduce correctly the solute trapping phenomena at a high interface velocity. But the drawback of the model is that the microstructure parameters vary depending on the interface thickness and the presence of anomalous interface effects.</p>
<p>The next change is axiom was when Steinbach<span class="citation" data-cites="Steinbach1999"><sup><a href="#ref-Steinbach1999" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span> assumed the interface to be a mixture of solid and liquid phases with different compositions, but constant in their ratio (partition coefficient). The model only worked for dilute alloys.</p>
<h2 id="binary-kks-model">Binary KKS Model</h2>
<p>A different derivation of governing equations came from Losert.<span class="citation" data-cites="Losert1998"><sup><a href="#ref-Losert1998" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> It was long been realized that the governing equations describing alloy solidification are similar to the ones corresponding to pure material. Using this concept, Losert extended the thin-interface PFM for a pure material to an alloy case. However, the model had two unrealistic assumptions. The first is that the model assumed the liquidus and solidus lines to be parallel. And secondly they assumed a constant solute diffusivity throughout the system like in the WBM model.</p>
<p>Building on the approach of Losert, the first successful and widely adopted model for binary-alloy solidification was presented by Seong Gyoon Kim, Won Tae Kim and Toshio Suzuki.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kim1999"><sup><a href="#ref-Kim1999" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> They utilized the correspondence between the variables of enthalpy-temperature equations and composition-chemical-potential equations to derive an alloy phase field model from the phase field model of pure elements. An important assumption of the model is the equality of chemical potentials of components at the interface.[^1]</p>
<h2 id="the-interface-width-problem">The Interface-Width Problem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If the PFM interface width is of the order of a real interface, the needed computational mesh size for mesoscale simulation amplifies<span class="citation" data-cites="Karma1998"><sup><a href="#ref-Karma1998" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>. If not, various anomalous interface effects are observed<span class="citation" data-cites="Almgren1999"><sup><a href="#ref-Almgren1999" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem of finite interface width is as such. Generally, a binary PFM model consists of two equations. The phase-field evolution equation and the concentration-field evolution equation (the diffusion equation). There are three parameters in the phase-field equation with definite relationships with interface’s energy, width and mobility. For the interface dynamics of the PFM to correspond to that of a real interface, the relationships between the parameters need to be precisely determined. One way to do so is to set the interface width of the PFM to the value corresponding to that of a real interface. This demands the grid size of the computational mesh to be even smaller, about <span class="math inline">\(&lt;1nm\)</span>. Mesoscale simulations then become almost impossible owing to a needed much larger grid size.</p>
<p>This restriction was overcome in a remarkable work of Karma and Rappel.<span class="citation" data-cites="Karma1998"><sup><a href="#ref-Karma1998" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> They showed that for the solidification of pure substances which have the same heat capacities and thermal diffusivity in solid and liquid forms, trhe dynamics of an interface with a vanishingly small width (that is, classical sharp interface dynamics) can be described correctly by a PFM with a finite thin interface width, given that a novel relationship between the real interface mobility and phase-field mobility is adopted. The interface width does need to be much smaller than the characteristic length scales of the diffusion field as well as the interface curvature.</p>
<p>The PFMs developed with this concept of finite interface width still suffered from anomalous interface effects. This was shown by Almgren<span class="citation" data-cites="Almgren1999"><sup><a href="#ref-Almgren1999" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. The effects include a chemical potential jump at the interface which causes an exaggerated solute-trapping effect. Such effects only become significant with increasing interface width.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-trapping-solution">The Anti-trapping Solution</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>All the anomalous interface effects could be suppressed by introducing an antitrapping current term into the diffusion equation<span class="citation" data-cites="Karma2001"><sup><a href="#ref-Karma2001" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solution was proposed by Karma<span class="citation" data-cites="Karma2001"><sup><a href="#ref-Karma2001" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span><span class="citation" data-cites="Echebarria2004"><sup><a href="#ref-Echebarria2004" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span>. To act against the solute-trapping current driven by the chemical potential gradient, an antitrapping current term was introduced to the diffusion equation. This suppressed the anomalous interface effects.</p>
<p>Following these findings, a model new PFM was proposed<span class="citation" data-cites="Kim2004"><sup><a href="#ref-Kim2004" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. It is based on the fact that all the anomalous interface effects originate from the finite interface width in the diffusion equation, not in the phase-field equation. The anomalous interface effects can then be suppressed by decoupling the interface width <span class="math inline">\(2\xi_d\)</span> in the diffusion equation from the width <span class="math inline">\(2\xi_d\)</span> in the phase-field equation and taking the limit <span class="math inline">\(2\xi_d \rightarrow 0\)</span>. In numerical computations, however, the minimum <span class="math inline">\(2\xi_d\)</span> value which one can take appears to be slightly above the grid size <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>. Therefore the solute-trapping phenomenon persists to a certain extent, as long as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> in the computation is much thicker than the real interface width.</p>
<p>Next was the derivation of a PFM for multi-component systems with arbitrary thermodynamic properties under the equal chemical potential condition. This was done by Kim<span class="citation" data-cites="Kim2007"><sup><a href="#ref-Kim2007" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> and is discussed in detail in Chapter <a href="notes/pfm_kks.html">KKS</a>.</p>
