Undergrad Projects @ IIT Madras
===

## Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Lab | Guide: Prof. G. Phanikumar

### A SYCL based Multi-Phase-Field solver for large scale microstructure simulations.

We developed a finite-difference solver of the Kim-Kim-Suzuki model in C++ and integrated it with [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/), MPI and [OneAPI](https://www.oneapi.io/) libraries. A parabolic approximation of free energy function allows the solver to be coupled with an open-source or encrypted database like ThermoCalc or Pandat. 


### An OpenCL based Phase-Field solver of basic microstructure evolution phenomenon.

We Developed OpenCL based codes for finite-difference simulations of  Spinodal Decomposition and Dendritic Solidification and did parametric studies on the effect of undercooling, boundary conditions, anisotropy and other parameters on the microstructure.


## Combinatorial Alloy Design & Correlative Microscopy Group | Guide: Prof. K. G. Pradeep

### Synthesis and characterization of the FeMnCoCrCu High Entropy Alloy.

Casted multiple Cu varying alloy compositions in the Vacuum Induction Furnace & performed solutionizing treatments. Used X-Ray Diffraction and Optical Microscopy to calculate grain size and morphology and identify precipitates formed. Further attempted to precipitate Cu clusters via heat treatments for improving its strength. 


### Atom Probe Tomography (APT) Data Analysis for feature detection in a MAX Phase
*Young Research Fellowship ([YRF](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/2020fellows.html)) 2020 Project*

Identified solute segregation by reconstructing the mass spectrum and raw APT data of a $Cr_2Al(Si)C$ MAX Phase. Investigated methods of feature detection for efficient identification of interfaces and clusters in APT data.
